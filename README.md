# y86-processor-verilog
A simple implementation of y86-processor (see CSAPP3e, chap4).

## ORIGIN
Most part of code about the design of processor are from CS:APP3e Web Aside ARCH:VLOG
Verilog Implementation of a Pipelined Y86-64 Processor (See [CSAPP Waside](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/waside.html))
Randal E. Bryant and David R. O`Hallaron have all the right about this part.

## Development
We are tring to implement it in Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, using Vivado 2017.2 as development platform.
Unfinished Function
- Test of the Processor
- I/O with RAM in FPGA
- Display simple status
